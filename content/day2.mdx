(day-3)

Hi,

I have started learning the core topics of js.
Simulatenously I am also learning typescript.

Though poeple prefer typescript, I still think it is not much of an improvement. Why :
* only checks the types at compile time. No runtime type checking.
* The ts code is at last compiled to JS code, where there is no types.
* can write JS code in TS file.
* If not a very big and collaborative project then I do not see any usecase of this.
* creates a hassle of importing types of all the libraries.

Still, I will go with the flow. Cause who am I to decide on this. If companies want that then there I am. :)

While studying I also stumbled on the Runtime called bun.
BUN :
* its a JS/TS runtime. (replacement for node)
* It is generally faster than node. (faster start, less memory, faster execution)
* It is based on Javascriptcore, an engine developed by apple for safari.
* I saw many articles praising it, but at the same time people on reddit were not so supportive of it.
* It also provides many inbuilt features i.e. :
    * inbuilt TS support
    * it's own package manager
    * compatible with node packages
    * its own bundler
    * its own optimised hot reloader (--hot)
    * etc
* there are some bugs and ... but its a good competetion to node

And at last, documenting what I have learnt :
* Js core :
    * interpreted language
    * single thread
    * callbacks
    * async nature
    * promises, async/await
