Hi there!

I am Kushgara Parasramka. A begineer in the field of __web development__ and __artificial intelligence__. I am starting to write blog from today as my first step to learn in public.

I will be writing about my journey from here on. I am starting this to keep a track of my journey to learning everything that interests me.

As I said, I am a begineer, I know a bit of web development and a pinch of AI. *:)*

I am currently focusing on web development and I am familiar with frameworks like react and node.
