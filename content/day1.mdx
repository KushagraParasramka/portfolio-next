Hi!

I knew JS and it's a damn good language to code in. But seeing everyone move towards TS, I got curious and started exploring about it.

To my surprise TS is nothing but JS with type safety. TS provides the developer the ability to define types in a JS code. Types make the language less prone to errors. It makes it easier for the developer to debug the code and maintain it. It is also easy for collaborating devs to understand the type of values coming in a variable *(improves readability)*.

TS can also be transpiled to JS anytime. Thus it is also compatible with any environment that runs JS.
